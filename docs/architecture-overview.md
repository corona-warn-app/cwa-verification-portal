# Software Design Verification Portal
by Alexander Stiefel (alexander.stiefel@t-systems.com)

##	Introduction
This document describes the component Verification Portal for the System “Corona Warn App”. In the world of the Corona Warn App the Verification Portal allows hotline employees to generate teleTANs which are used by users of the mobile App to upload their diagnostic keys. A teleTAN is a proof that somebody was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

This document links the overall system architecture with the software design of the Verification Portal , it links user stories with implementation inside the Verification Portal. 

This document is intended to be read by people who want to get insights how verification for hotline and health authorities works in detail, it is our guideline for implementation. This document is a mixture of software design and requirement specification, it may be splitted in future.

Please be aware that several aspects in this document are not final, certain important information is missing.

#	Overview
##	Purpose of the Software Component
The primary scope of the component is to create a proof certificate (teleTAN) whether users were positive tested for SARS-CoV-2 or not. The proof is generated by hotline employees based on the information the can obtain. The scope of the Verification Portal is just the creation of the proof certificate - the teleTAN. Not is scope is the support of validating the request of people calling the hotline.  


##	Context
The Verification Portal is part of the Portal Server. The Portal Server consists of this component and the Verification IAM. 

The context is:
- Verification Portal 
    - a web portal allowing to generate teleTAN
- Verification IAM
    - a Idenitity and Access Management software, managing users, right, roles and implementing two factor authentication
- One Time Password Generator
    - used to provide the 2nd factor for authentication
- Verification Server
    - System which trusts the Verification Portal and ultimatly generates the teleTAN


##	Core Entities
|Entitiy|	Definition|	
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|teleTAN|	Is a subtype of TAN with reduced length and life time. This TAN is handed over via phone and contains only uppercase letters and numbers, excluding 0,O and I,1. Length of teleTAN is 7 characters. The lifetime of a teleTAN is 1h. This entity is managed by Verification Server	|
|SARS-CoV-2 Test|	A SARS-CoV-2 Test aggregates several probes donated by a single person to verified whether they proof an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or not. A SARS-CoV-2 Test can have multiple states, “positive”, “negative”, “unknow”, “erroneous”	|
